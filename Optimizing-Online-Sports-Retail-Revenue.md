We will dive into product data such as pricing, reviews, descriptions, and ratings, as well as revenue and website traffic, to produce recommendations for its marketing and sales teams.

The database provided to us, sports, contains five tables, with product_id being the primary key for all of them:info, finance, reviews, traffic, and brands.
